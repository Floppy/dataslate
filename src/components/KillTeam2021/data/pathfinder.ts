MARKERLIGHTS
A markerlight is a device that projects a beam onto a target. Once an enemy has been 'painted' by such a beam, a torrent of targeting data is fed into the cadre tactical network, relaying ranges, triangulating optimum firing trajectories and superimposing aiming vectors to other T'au warriors, allowing them to engage the target with unerring accuracy.
MARKERLIGHT
1AP
Select one enemy operative Visible to this operative. That enemy operative gains 1 Markerlight token. An operative cannot perform this action if it is within Engagement Range of an enemy operative. If an operative would perform this action and a Shoot action in the same activation, only the target of that Shoot action's shooting attack can be selected for this action.
Operatives gain Markerlight tokens as specified by the Markerlight action above. In the Ready Operatives step of each Initiative phase, remove one Markerlight token that each operatives has.
Each time a friendly PATHFINDERS operative makes a shooting attack, it gains a number of cumulative benefits for that shooting attack depending on how many Markerlight tokens the target operative has. Operatives gain no markerlight benefits for shooting attacks made with EMP and fusion grenades.
