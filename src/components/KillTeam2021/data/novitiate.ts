In addition, you gain one Faith point at the end of an activation, if any of the following apply:
- During that activation, a friendly NOVITIATEðŸ’€ operative with the Combat specialism incapacitated an enemy operative in a combat.
- During that activation, a friendly NOVITIATEðŸ’€ operative with the Marksman specialism incapacitated an enemy operative with a shooting attack.
- During that activation, a friendly NOVITIATEðŸ’€ operative with the Staunch specialism performed a mission action.
- A friendly NOVITIATEðŸ’€ operative with the Scout specialism was activated and finished that activation within â¬Ÿ of the enemy drop zone.

Faith points can be subtracted so that friendly NOVITIATEðŸ’€ operatives can perform Acts of Faith listed below. Each Act of Faith will specify when it can be used, 
its effect and how many Faith points you must subtract from your total to use it. If you cannot subtract the required Faith points from your total, you cannot use that Act of Faith.

Unless otherwise specified, only one Act of Faith can be used during each activation (friendly or enemy). For example, a shooting attack is made against a friendly 
NOVITIATEðŸ’€ operative. In the Roll Defence Dice step of that shooting attack, that operative's controlling player decides to subtract 2 Faith points to use Divine Shield to 
retain one failed save as a successful normal save. No other Acts of Faith can then be performed during that activation (other than Faithful Blessing).
