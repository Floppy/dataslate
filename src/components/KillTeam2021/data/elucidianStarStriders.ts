the fourth Turning Point.

When making shooting attacks with the ranged weapons on this page:
* For the purposes of Line of Sight, draw Visibility and Cover lines from a friendly **NAVIS** (excluding **CANID**) or
**ELUCIA VHANE** operative that is not within Engagement Range of enemy operatives.
* For the purposes of the weapon's special rules, it is treated as if a friendly operative were making the shooting attack.

attacks made by Privateer Support Assets.
